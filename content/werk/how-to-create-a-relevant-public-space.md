Het boek ‘_How to create a relevant public space_’ bevat 280 pagina’s vol inspiratie voor architecten en andere creatieven, studenten, beleidsmakers en administrators. 

Het koffietafelboek bevat een prettige afwisseling tussen beeld en tekst. De visueel duidelijk te onderscheiden diepte-interviews, reportages en city tours nemen je mee in het onderwerp. De initiatiefnemer van het boek, Aat Vos, heeft als motto '_always strive for imperfection_' en dit komt terug in de opmaak van het boek.
